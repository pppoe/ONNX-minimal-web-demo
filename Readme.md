# What is this?

Sample code of running a neural network model in [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) in a minimalist style.

Everything runs locally within the browser using client's resource. 

The code shows how to:

1. Download the ONNX model
1. Open-up a local picture file
1. Run inference of the model over the picture
1. Show the result

## More about this (if needed) can be found in my blog post: [Title Blah blah]().
